# Prediciting Employee Attrition using IBM HR Analytics Dataset
This project aims at finding the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. The dataset used is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

1. This project is implemented in R
2. Different Classification Models, namely K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Bridge Neural Network and Random Forest, are prepared to predict Employee Attritio in the organization 
3. Model comparison based on the accuracy and selecting the best model
4. Data Visualization using ggplot2 library 

The project helps in coming out with important features that contribute to Employee leaving the company so that the HR can develop strategies to retain the employee.

## Environment
1. RStudio 
2. Libraries used:
    * utils: to import the dataset
    * caret: for creating predictive models
    * ggplot2: for data visualization
    * mlbench: for feature selection
    * apriori: for association rule mining
